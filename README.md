# SubRedditChecker
This project checks the existence of a list of subreddits and writes the existing ones to a file.

## Description
This Python application reads a list of subreddit names from a file (subreddits.txt), checks if they exist on Reddit, and writes the existing subreddits to another file (existing_subreddits.txt).

## Usage 
1. Prepare a file named subreddits.txt in the same directory as the script. This file should contain the names of the subreddits you want to check, one per line.

2. Run the script:

``` sh
python subreddit_checker.py
```
The script will create an existing_subreddits.txt file with the names of the subreddits that exist.
